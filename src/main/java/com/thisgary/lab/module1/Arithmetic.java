/*
Activity 2
----------
You have been assigned to write a program to perform an arithmetic addition and subtraction for two (2)
integer numbers key-in by the user. The program should only accept the number key-in by the user as a
positive number. Finally, display the result for addition and subtraction. You should write your program
using an object-oriented approach.
