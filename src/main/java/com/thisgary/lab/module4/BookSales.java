/*
Exercise
--------
Customer who buying the books will entitle for specified discount. Customer, who has a membership,
will receive 15% discount. There are two (2) types of a book. For beginner level, the price is RM50.00
and RM100.00 for advanced level.
The program must have three (3) constructors, including default constructor. The second constructor is
used to find the price per book based on the type of book key-in by the user.
The third constructor is used to calculate the total amount customer needs to pay after he/she key-in
the information such as membership (Y/N), type of book (A-advanced, B-beginner) and quantity of a
book bought.
You need to write the program called BookSales.java and using the main class to display the price for each
type of the book and display the quantity of the book customer bought and total amount customer needed
to pay
